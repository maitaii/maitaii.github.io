# About me

Hi, i'm Leo and i love Information Security. 
I have a BSc in Computer Science Engineering and i play lots of CTFs with fibonhack and about:blankets, mostly doing web challenges.

My main interest is web security/exploitation but i'm trying to learn as much as i can from other field like browser security, reverse engineering and binary exploitation

I'm an everyday learner and i love share what i've learnt in order to make the road easier for the others :)

Follow me on [Twitter][twitter] and [Github][github] to stay tuned to my writeup and research that i will publish in the future
